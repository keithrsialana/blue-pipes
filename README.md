## Description
BluePipes is a web application designed to streamline the process of managing and tracking pipelines. It integrates Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) practices to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to implement a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This setup allows for automated testing of component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the `develop` branch, and facilitates deployment when code is merged from `develop` to the `main` branch.
